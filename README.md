# Crowdfunding Platform Smart Contract

## Vision

The Crowdfunding Platform project aims to create a decentralized way for individuals and organizations to raise funds for their projects. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures that crowdfunding is transparent, secure, and immutable, allowing creators to raise funds while providing contributors with assurance that their contributions are being properly tracked.

## Features

- **Create Crowdfunding Project**: Users can create new crowdfunding projects with a goal amount and project details.
- **Contribute to Project**: Contributors can make donations to support a project, and all contributions are recorded on-chain for transparency.
- **Track Funding**: The platform keeps track of the total funds contributed toward each project, allowing creators and contributors to monitor progress.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet/Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x0de196a858be039452477419984b6d5aec9ca53058d1a42ad354e98739c5d4a5`

## How It Works

1. **Create Crowdfunding Project**:

   - Users call the `create_project` function to create a new project for crowdfunding.
   - The function takes the project name and goal amount as input and stores the project details securely on the blockchain.
